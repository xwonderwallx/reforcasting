      " SXSW 2022 was overrun with NFTs and all things Web3 but had little focus on the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin ecosystem. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "South by Southwest — commonly referred to as “South By” or “SXSW” — has returned to Austin, Texas this year to showcase the latest trends in interactive media, music, art, film and technology. While SXSW runs through March 20, 2022, the entertainment and technology festival kicked off its first weekend with a large focus on Web3 and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n",
      "\n",
      "SXSW’s attendees’ interest in NFTs and the future of the internet was particularly evident at the venue hosted by Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) — a business and creative unit formed by Fox Entertainment in 2021. On March 11, the first day of SXSW, a line consisting of hundreds of people wrapped around the streets of Fifth and Trinity in downtown Austin as SXSW badge holders anxiously awaited entrance to BCL’s interactive NFT venue that also showcased Web3-focused panels.\n",
      "\n",
      "BCL CEO Scott Greenberg told Cointelegraph that the company was the exclusive blockchain sponsor of SXSW this year:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, BCL’s event space appeared to be one of the most widely attended SXSW spots, especially for those interested in nonfungible tokens. The venue, which was open through Sunday, March 13, included a gallery of NFTs created by leading content creators, exclusive NFT drops of music from official SXSW artists, NFTs from feature films premiering during the festival, along with a number of thought leadership sessions on Web3 development. “We had over 60 speakers and 40 panels on Web3, entertainment and how this provides new value to creators. SXSW 2022 was really about NFTs and the Metaverse, and our goal was to educate attendees. I think we achieved this,” said Greenberg. \n",
      "\n",
      "Greenberg said that BCL’s SXSW activation space consisted of interactive rooms to provide attendees with hands-on educational experiences to learn about the decentralized internet, also known as “Web3.” For example, BCL allowed festival-goers to create proof-of-attendance-protocols (POAPs) to document their attendance at SXSW. BCL’s POAPs served as NFT badges given to attendees of both virtual and in-person events that took place during the first weekend of South By. \n",
      "\n",
      "The venue also featured a “BCL_RecordBlocks” station, which enabled attendees to “listen and earn” music NFTs from over 30 musicians. “The concept here was to let attendees choose from over 100 songs to listen to. After listening, a QR-code would appear on the screen in front of them that could be scanned for a music NFT,” explained Greenberg. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said that the exhibit let attendees better understand how to obtain music NFTs while also enabling individuals to connect directly with the musicians featured. “In gaming, you have play-to-earn. This is listen-to-earn to show how we can connect artists and fans together using NFTs,” said Greenberg. Given that the Web3 space is still developing, BCL had staff members in white lab coats managing the exhibit to help onboard users to MetaMask, Coinbase or Rainbow wallets where they could then store their NFTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BCL venue also featured an “SXSW x BCL NFT Ledger” room which showcased a visualization of all SXSW-related data being recorded in real-time. “This exhibit featured Polygon wallet addresses from people claiming our free NFTs like Record Blocks. Everything displayed comes from the BCL marketplace,” explained Greenberg. He said that data will be recorded during the entirety of SXSW and will then be minted into an NFT. Greenberg said:\n",
      "\n",
      "NFTs were also widely discussed at “The AlgoRanch,” a pop-up event hosted by Algorand, a blockchain network designed to solve security, scalability and decentralization issues. Algorand has also taken an interest in NFTs, specifically when it comes to ensuring sustainability since the network uses a Pure proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to demonstrate recent NFT innovation, Algorand featured a number of sessions during its SXSW pop-up focused on nonfungible token projects. For instance, Shrina Kurani — a Democrat running for Congress in California’s 41st District — appeared on a panel to shed insight on the launch of her NFT collection. Known as “Kurani for Congr3ss,” she explained that this is a collection of 230 NFTs designed to raise awareness for her campaign while highlighting climate-friendly solutions in the Web3 space. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to detail the importance of her NFT collection being carbon neutral, Kurani was on stage alongside Priya Samant, CEO of Abris — a sustainable NFT marketplace built on Alogrand that partnered with Kurani on this particular drop. “The main collection featured 230 NFTs that represent the 230 billion tons of carbon remain in the world‘s ‘carbon budget,’” explained Kurani. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kurani further told Cointelegraph that she is the first-ever federal candidate to launch NFTs for a congressional campaign:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurani added that NFTs allow congressional candidates to represent the American population, claiming that 3 out of 10 Americans under the age of 30 engage with cryptocurrency. “This is a way to get those individuals involved. We can also reach more people and educate the population on financial literacy. The main thesis of Web3 is about decentralization, consumer empowerment and ownership, which is why we are excited about NFTs,” she remarked. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Kurani’s NFT collection, the American Rapper Darryl McDaniels also known as “DMC,” announced the tokenization of his song Million Scars at Algorand’s SXSW pop-up event. For this launch, McDaniels used Stoi.org, a technology platform built on the Algorand blockchain that features a carbon-neutral footprint and low transaction costs. McDaniels told Cointelegraph that blockchain technology allows musicians to solve common problems in the music industry:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ripple House, hosted by fintech firm Ripple, also featured a variety of NFT projects to highlight the company’s new Creator Fund. Monica Long, general manager of RippleX — Ripple’s innovation arm — told Cointelegraph that the fund is a $250 million commitment to help creators with their NFT projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Long, Ripple’s Creator Fund examines a variety of NFT use cases, but the company plans to focus primarily on sustainability, real estate, music and entertainment moving forward. Long added that developers can currently experiment with NFT functionality on the XRP Ledger using NFT-Devnet, a beta environment for developers to use XLS-20d — the native NFT standard RippleX is proposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are working on a new standard to make the NFT minting, management and burning experience more natively built into the protocol. Other chains have NFTs programmed through smart contracts, so a lot of these capabilities are now built into the XLS-20d standard,” said Long. The executive added that Ripple anticipates the standard to go up for mainnet amendment voting in early April.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, some were already demonstrating how the XRP Ledger could be used for NFTs. Kaj Leroy, co-founder and CEO of Xpunks — an NFT project built on the XRP Ledger — gave a glimpse into the project by creating custom JPG avatars for attendees. Leroy told Cointelegraph that Xpunks is currently waiting for the XLS-20d standard to be released before minting the actual Xpunk NFTs. “These are just JPGs now, but once XLS-20d launches we will make a big collage of all these JPGs, mint it, then send it to everyone who came to our booth at SXSW.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Stellar also jumped on the opportunity to showcase NFT development during SXSW this year. The open-source decentralized protocol hosted a 48-hour NFT hackathon during the first weekend of South By, bringi newcomers and experienced developers together to build a project on the Stellar network that incorporates nonfungible tokens. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to the prompt, artists were instructed to create NFT artwork that “embodies the metaverse.” Stellar then sent XLM funds to users’ Litemint wallet addresses to cover the minting fees. Participants had the opportunity to win $1,500 worth of XLM prizes for participating in the challenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major topic of conversation during SXSW this year was Web3 and the rise of the Metaverse. Some of the most in-depth conversations regarding metaverse development took place at Fluf World’s Fluf Haus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Smeele, co-founder and CEO of Non-Fungible Labs and Metaverse environment Fluf World, told Cointelegraph that the company wanted to use SXSW as an opportunity to discuss plans for the launch of its “Metaverse Manifesto.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are a number of different definitions for the Metaverse, Smeele explained that he believes it represents the future of the internet and how people will engage with it. As such, Smeele noted that the Metaverse requires standards that Web3 companies must address:\n",
      "\n",
      "Smeele said that the sessions hosted at Fluf Haus focused on sustainability, inclusion, diversity and other topics shaping the Metaverse. “We had about seven ecosystem partners present to discuss these topics. Altered State Machine, Carbon Click, The Seekers, Silo team and a number of others came together to address important issues. Decentralization is about putting power back in the hands of individuals, but with great power comes great responsibility,” commented Smeele. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although it’s notable that NFTs and Web3 were major topics of discussion during SXSW 2022, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin (BTC) were largely left out of the conversation. Dan Held, growth lead at Kraken and a serial Bitcoin entrepreneur, highlighted this point in his recent recap of SXSW. In his post, Held noted:\n",
      "\n",
      "A few pop-up events during SXSW focused on the crypto ecosystem. The Grit Daily house featured a fireside chat on March 10 with Alex Mashinsky, CEO of Celsius Network. Tal Bentov, vice president of lending at Celsius told Cointelegraph that she believes there was a genuine interest in crypto at SXSW, which is why it was important for Celsius to be one of the few crypto companies that showed up. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, there were very few official SXSW panels related to cryptocurrency. One of the panels that did discuss crypto in-depth was entitled Financial Surveillance in a Cashless Society. Sheila Warren, head of data, blockchain and digital assets at the World Economic Forum, was one of the panelists for this session. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warren told Cointelegraph that the discussion focused on policy and how regulators think about central bank digital currencies versus cryptocurrency. “We didn’t necessarily conclude anything specific, but the more we go digital, the more opportunities there are for tracking and tracing. There are ways to mitigate the ability for private and public sectors to track what you are up to online, though,” said Warren.\n",
      "\n",
      "She added that an impressive number of SXSW attendees were present for this panel, demonstrating how important this topic is for many people, along with those who work in policymaking. Warren further remarked that while she thinks NFTs are the gateway into crypto, she hopes that South By attendees realize that a lot more is happening within the crypto ecosystem aside from NFTs:\n",

      "I get really animated when discussing Bitcoin’s energy use. And by “Bitcoin’s energy use,” I mean the amount of energy bitcoin mining uses. I tend to say Bitcoin’s energy use isn’t a problem and that we should instead focus on Bitcoin’s emissions. [Note: we capitalize the blockchain (Bitcoin) and use lowercase or trading symbols (bitcoin/BTC) for the asset.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Before diving into any details, it’s important to make clear what bitcoin (BTC) mining is and why it needs to use a lot of energy. Mining is the mechanism that sustains the financial infrastructure of the Bitcoin network and it is energy intensive by design to provide ironclad security.\n",

      "In a casual setting, my favorite way to showcase that Bitcoin’s energy use “doesn’t matter” is to append Bitcoin’s energy use to the U.S.’s energy consumption and ask if it looks like Bitcoin is using too much energy (see below).\n",

      "Using this graphic, it looks like the U.S. has an energy problem and, given China consumes 79% more energy than the U.S., China has an even bigger energy problem. Bitcoin only uses an estimated 134 TWh of energy per year, a scant 1.9% and 3.5% that China and the U.S. consume annually. You can imagine the path the rest of the conversation takes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I included this graphic to illustrate that the comparison game is usually a waste of time. Bitcoiners often do this unproductively, comparing bitcoin mining energy consumption to Christmas light energy consumption or the like, and leaving the argument at that (Christmas lights do use a lot of energy, however). I even did it in a report I published last April comparing it to video games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I probably committed a cardinal sin in that report by trying to convince the reader that Bitcoin’s energy use was “worth it” because Bitcoin is a “global, trustless, permissionless payment settlement network and a digital, aspirational store of value.” Let’s save the morality lecture for another time and instead assume, for sake of argument, that Bitcoin is worth using energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortest answer is that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, thought the best way to fairly distribute bitcoins was by creating a system in which miners exchange something valuable – energy – for the right to claim the bitcoins (the shortest shortest answer is actually “anti-spam”).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A longer answer should add something about the need to ward off attackers if you want to successfully decentralize trust in a network. Mining is energy-intensive so that it is prohibitively expensive to attack Bitcoin. Remember: Mining doesn’t use energy to validate transactions; energy consumption is the price exacted for securing the entire network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding point about transaction validation is important because it is enticing to compare the energy density of Bitcoin transactions to something like Visa (V). Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second compared to Visa’s 24,000+. But, remember, Bitcoin doesn’t use energy to validate transactions. The miners’ job is to secure the network, add new blocks of data to the chain and win bitcoin in return. That’s what they spend energy on. They’re not primarily interested in validating transactions. That consensus on the true state of the network is primarily the job of non-mining, Bitcoin full nodes. Plus, Bitcoin transactions are not the same as Visa or other payment processors’ transactions. Bitcoin transactions provide (probabilistic) finality, Visa’s don’t. Visa’s success depends on the success of separate systems. Visa’s “token” is not native to its network.\n",
      "\n",
      "A growing number of institutions have recognized the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and have implemented internal mandates. Ignoring the “SG” for a moment (although they are immensely important and relevant to Bitcoin), it makes sense from an investment perspective to consider the environmental impact of Bitcoin’s energy use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin’s environmental impact has more to do with the greenhouse gas emissions (mainly carbon) associated with the production of the energy used for mining and less to do with the absolute amount of energy it consumes. We’ll consider renewable energy sources like solar, hydro and wind power as “clean” given their relatively low carbon density (ignoring their negative externalities for now). The cleaner the energy mix, the smaller the environmental impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "A common environmental critique against bitcoin mining was that most miners were in China (>80% in February 2020), a country highly dependent on coal-fired energy (although Chinese miners used a surprising amount of clean energy). When China banned crypto mining in May 2021, miners left for the U.S., Kazakhstan and Russia. Time will tell whether those miners will settle on using clean energy sources, but they seem largely set on doing so, at least in the U.S..\n",
      "\n",
      "In the report I wrote last year, I relied on research published by Cambridge University to support the position that bitcoin mining uses a respectable percentage of renewables in its energy mix. The 2020 study suggested that 39% of total energy for Bitcoin mining came from renewable sources in 2019 (compared to 28% in 2018) with 76% of miners using renewable sources as part of their energy mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a forum of Bitcoin miners aimed at promoting energy usage transparency, sharing best practices and educating the broader public on the benefits of Bitcoin and bitcoin mining, has shared data that suggests 58.5% of global bitcoin mining uses renewable energy (66.1% for BMC members). That’s relatively clean. It is worth noting that inclusion in the BMC is entirely optional, so there might be some social-desirability response bias to sort through in their survey data.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were plenty of other ESG related topics I could have covered in this like how bitcoin mining could incentivize more renewable energy generation, improve electrical grid intermittency, revitalize local economies, empower oft-forgotten communities, or act as a “load balancing economic battery.” In reality bitcoin mining and its energy use is a complicated, multidisciplinary topic. By way of example, my view is that an investment in Bitcoin could be considered an investment in ESG, given its potential impact on energy generation. This column on its own doesn’t represent a full defense of that thesis because there are so many angles that weren’t considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very least, I hope this inspires more discussions about Bitcoin’s true energy cleanliness and broader impact.\n",

      "Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, testified for over 10 hours this week at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, offering deeper details on the events that anticipated the FTX debacle in November 2022. From Ellison’s testimony, jurors learned that she planned to leave Alameda months before its collapse, but feared a bank run on FTX amidst the crypto market downturn. The week also featured a recording presented as evidence in the case showing the exact moment Ellison told employees about Alameda’s use of FTX customer deposits. Among the key moments of Bankman-Fried’s trial were revelations of fabricated balance sheets in order to deceive crypto lenders, as well as BlockFi CEO Zac Prince’s testimony.

Bankman-Fried believed Binance leaked an Alameda balance sheet to the media in 2022. According to a document from Nov. 6, 2022, Bankman-Fried wrote that Binance had been “engaging in a PR campaign against us.” It continued, saying that Binance “leaked a balance sheet; blogged about it; fed it to Coindesk; then announced very publicly that they were selling $500m of FTT in response to it while telling customers to be wary of FTX.”\n",

      "Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies fell slightly but finished a largely upbeat week higher than when they started the week, withstanding the U.S. central bank's first interest rate hike in four years and Russia's escalating attacks on Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading about $41,200, off about 1.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin topped $42,000 late during U.S. trading hours Friday, a more than 7% increase from where it started the week as investors digested the long-expected Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point increase on Wednesday and global unrest tied to Russia's invasion. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands a little under 2,900, a 1.8% drop over the same period, but well up from where it began the week. Most other major cryptos were in the red over the weekend. Trading volume fell over the past three days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's been a good week for bitcoin,\" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. \"We have been holding support above $40,500. If we can break through the next resistance line at $42,500, we could see a breakout to $45,000 as we saw in the last day of February.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "DiPasquale added that \"low trading volume is normal for weekend activity,\" and he expected it to increase during the week. \"With the equities markets rising again, there is a moment to be had in bitcoin, [ether] and other assets if Monday starts strong,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 2% on Friday, while the S&P 500 was up a little over 1%. Gold fell 1.2%. The upswing in stocks and cryptos late in the week suggested that investors were willing to embrace more risk than they had been just a few days before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weekend saw a new round of atrocities in Ukraine and continued fallout that could undermine the already jittery, global economy. According to one report Mariupol, a strategic Black Sea port that would help Russia control the southern Ukraine coastline, was days away from falling. Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal story Sunday said that Russia has largely failed so far to demonstrate that its economy could thrive in the face of fierce sanctions from countries opposed to its unprovoked attack, and would take years to achieve this objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "DiPasquale noted that many investors have associated February's drop in equities and crypto markets with a similar decline in March 2020. \"While there was a lot of uncertainty, the wrong thing to do then was to sell low; the next two years saw historic rises,\" he said. \"Hedge funds like ours have a generally optimistic sentiment given the market's history of rising through uncertainty even after periods of turbulence.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Razer (RAZFF) used to talk a big game about itself. The Singapore-based manufacturer of gaming PCs and peripherals was once called “the Apple of the gaming world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some lapped it up, but industry analysts snickered as channel data showed the company didn’t really ship many PCs. Its keyboards, mice and other accessories were well received, but the PCs not so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, after its initial public offering (IPO), Razer became more modest. As part of the IPO it had to list how much it actually sold of its products. The results were underwhelming. While its competitors shipped tens of millions of gaming PCs and notebooks, Razer could barely muster 600,000, according to analysts and others who reviewed its earnings. For some models, the shipments were under 1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Razer’s bark was louder than its bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a listed company it was harder to throw around monikers like “Apple of the Gaming World,” so Razer needed to pivot. In 2020, its CEO, Min-Liang Tan, said that Razer was a “lifestyle brand” and the company put a larger emphasis on alternatives to selling PCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company settled on payments and fintech to diversify, applying for one of Singapore’s coveted digital banking licenses. But regulators in Singapore declined Razer’s application, limiting it to payments, a cut-throat industry with thin margins. Of course, Razer could apply for a license somewhere other than Singapore, such as Malaysia, but so far it hasn’t made a move.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late 2021, Razer decided to shutter its Razer Pay wallet service because it couldn’t carve out a meaningful niche in Southeast Asia’s crowded payments marketplace, dominated by super app Grab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Razer still has a foot in the payments game, but its most recent earnings show that its efforts to move the company away from hardware and peripherals has stalled. At the end of the last fiscal year software and services contributed 10.6% to the company’s revenue. While the division’s raw revenue is up, overall it actually accounts for less, coming in at 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total payment volume for Razer Gold, its virtual credits service used to monetize games, is up 56% year on year as the coronavirus pandemic continues to keep people inside and gaming. Razer's fintech arm, which provides merchant services, hit $7 billion in revenue for 2021, up 63.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theoretically, GameFi would take a big bite out of Razer Gold as a way to monetize and finance games. When asked about this a PR rep directed CoinDesk to a statement in the earnings report from Razer’s CEO, which said the company intends to “explore decentralized finance” but otherwise said nothing concrete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shareholders don’t care. The stock is a catastrophe, especially in the pandemic era when investors put a premium on anything to do with gaming and PCs as locked-down consumers spend more in this segment as a way to entertain themselves and stay productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its listing in Hong Kong in 2017 the stock is down nearly 47%. This is incredible when compared to its peers. Logitech (LOGI), which makes PC peripherals for productivity and gaming, is up nearly 110% during the same time period; Taiwan’s MSI, a well-known gaming PC manufacturer; is up 90%; and Corsair (CRSR), which listed in late 2020, is up by around 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of this might be because Razer is actually a fairly small company, despite its cult following. Net profits for the year were around $43.4 million. Last fiscal year it was a mere $800,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Razer’s future appears to be as a private company (there was talk about a U.S.-listing, but that would devolve into meme stock territory) as investors move towards de-listing it from the Hong Kong exchange through a buyout. That might be the best move because investors don’t seem to be too enthusiastic about Razer as a PC gaming company or even a payments company.\n",

      "\n",
      "Short-term momentum signals have turned upward, especially after a downside exhaustion signal appeared on March 7. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising above oversold levels (above 50), suggesting the four-month-long downtrend in price is nearing an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there is significant overhead resistance on the charts, which could stall the current price bounce.\n",

Crypto threatens that power, even if the threat is somewhat distant for now.
