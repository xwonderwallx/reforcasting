class BaseEvaluator:
    """
    A foundational class designed to serve as a superclass for specific evaluator
    implementations across various domains.

    The `BaseEvaluator` class introduces a common interface with an `evaluate` method
    intended to be overridden by subclasses. These subclasses can represent evaluators
    for a wide range of applications, such as assessing the performance of machine learning
    models, analyzing financial strategies, or any other context where evaluation is needed.

    Methods:
        evaluate(): Placeholder method for performing evaluation logic. Subclasses should
                    override this method with specific evaluation logic relevant to their domain.

    def evaluate(self):
        """
        A placeholder method meant to be overridden by subclasses with specific evaluation logic.

        The `evaluate` method in the `BaseEvaluator` class does not implement any logic and is
        intended to define a common interface for all subclasses. By overriding this method,
        subclasses specify how evaluation should be performed in their specific context.

        Subclasses should provide a return value as appropriate for their evaluation process,
        which might include scores, metrics, qualitative assessments, or any other form of evaluation result.

        Returns:
            The return value is dependent on the specific implementation in subclasses.
            It could be a numerical score, a set of metrics, or any other type relevant to the evaluation.
