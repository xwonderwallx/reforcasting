Some people believe the only taxable transaction is cashing out from crypto to fiat (U.S. dollars, or USD).',\n  \"This is very far from the truth – many different types of crypto transactions are taxable, not just cashing out to fiat currency. Crypto-to-crypto swaps (including non-fungible tokens), staking rewards, mining and airdrops are all examples of taxable events within the crypto ecosystem that don't involve cashing out to fiat.\",\n  'This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.',\n  \"Let's take a look at an example to understand this concept better:\",\n  'In early 2021, Timmy bought ether (ETH) on Coinbase. He sent this ETH to his MetaMask wallet, and started using decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, staking some ETH on Lido and buying/selling NFTs on OpenSea. By December 2021, Timmy made some solid profits and pulled out the majority of his cryptocurrency by selling for USD on Coinbase.',\n  \"If Timmy is in the group believing only that final transaction into USD was taxable, he’d be incorrect – many of the transactions he made, such as making swaps on Uniswap and buying/selling NFTs, are all individually taxable transactions. Knowing what types of transactions are taxable, and which aren't, can better help you put funds aside to be prepared for tax season.\",\n  'A common theme we see in the crypto community is anonymity. Although anonymity is very possible in crypto, and is a pillar to decentralization, it only lasts as long as the government/Internal Revenue Service wants it. Meaning, you can think your wallets are anonymous and untraceable but in reality that is not the case.',\n  'In its simplest terms, the blockchain is a public ledger where every transaction is verified in a decentralized manner, making all the transactions public domain (outside of a few exceptions). If you go to etherscan.io you can look at any wallet, any transaction, any contract and see the exact details of what is transpiring on the Ethereum blockchain.',\n  \"Because of this public transparency, it is very easy for the IRS to link “anonymous” wallets to people. This is because at the beginning of nearly every person's transaction history is an on-ramp via know-your-customer (KYC) rules that exchanges like Coinbase are required to follow. These exchanges are required to report customers’ activity to the IRS, which gives the agency information about users. From this on-ramp, if the assets are sent to a decentralized wallet provider or non KYC’d exchange, the IRS can follow these transactions and easily associate each new wallet with the person who funded it. If you buy ETH on Coinbase, send to Metamask then bridge to Avalanche, the IRS will associate the Metamask and Avalanche wallet with the KYC’d Coinbase account that funded the wallets, thus revealing the wallets’ owners.\",\n  'The blockchain is quite easily traceable as is. With the IRS investing billions of dollars into blockchain tracking technology, it will continue to be able to have visibility on-chain.',\n  'Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022',\n  'Many people believe that as you take profits the total gains only go up and you end up having to pay this inflated amount come tax season. Although this is partially true there are some things to know about how taxes are calculated, and the strategies to lower them.',\n  'First, you need to understand what capital gains are: profits generated from selling a cryptocurrency – or any other asset, for that matter. When you sell a digital asset like crypto for more than you bought it, you must report that capital gain to the IRS on your taxes. Many people think this is where taxes end.',\n  'Fortunately, at the end of each year, the IRS allows you to match your capital gains and losses to determine your net capital gain or loss. You can use up to $3,000 in net capital losses to offset your other taxable income, and any additional losses can be carried forward into future years to offset either capital gains or up to $3,000 per year in ordinary income.',\n  'For example, Timmy buys 2x APE NFTs at $50 each. They dip initially and he sells one for a loss at $40, but then they pump and he sells the second one for $70. Although Timmy profited $20 on the second sale, the $10 loss from the first sale will offset these gains and he will only have to pay taxes on the net $10 profit.',\n  'Now that you understand capital gains, here are the ways to deliberately lower taxes once transactions are locked in for profit:',\n  'Tax loss harvesting: If you hold assets that are worth less than what you paid, you can sell to realize these losses in order to offset cap gains! Because there is no wash-sale rule for digital assets (yet), you can buy them back immediately after selling. (Check out ZenLedger’s ’’Tax Loss Harvesting Guide’’ and tool for more details on how to execute these savings.)',\n  'Another way to lower taxes once profits are locked in is via donations. Donations of appreciated assets/charitable donations are tax-deductible for taxpayers who itemize deductions. For 2021, the IRS also provides a tax deduction of up to $3,000 for people using the standard deduction. Learn more about crypto donations here.',\n  'Read more: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022',\n  \"When importing wallets and organizing transactions in a crypto tax software like ZenLedger, people are often only calculating their taxes for one year but don't realize that all transaction data prior to the reporting year need to be imported as well.\",\n  'To get your current year taxes correct, the software actually needs to look at the transactions from previous years so it can find your correct cost basis including gains, losses and transaction fees. So if you only want your 2021 tax reports but have been trading crypto since 2016, we would still need all of your transactions from the very first trade to get all of your reports as accurate as possible.',\n  'For example: Timmy bought 1 bitcoin in 2017 for $10,000 then sold it in 2021 for $50,000. Timmy knows he needs to pay taxes on profit, but if he only imports his 2021 transactions the software will be unable to see how much he paid for the bitcoin in 2017, and therefore unable to calculate the profits/tax liability accurately. Once he imports all his historical data, the software will see that he held the bitcoin for four years and had a gain of $40,000, and apply the necessary tax implications.',\n  'Large numbers of transactions and little guidance from the IRS can make doing your crypto taxes a very daunting task. It is important to keep in mind the basics mentioned above so you can better manage your portfolio and be prepared for tax season.',\n  \"Meet the yoga instructors, limo drivers and real estate agents who've been to hell and back.\",\n  'Tax guidance lags innovation. So does tax software. Meanwhile, misconceptions abound. If not careful, investors can end up owing more tax than expected and having to unload crypto to pay the bill.',\n  'Investors in MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block and Coinbase need to consider how wild price swings will affect results, not only directly but indirectly due to complex tax accounting rules.',\n  \"Learn more about Consensus 2024, CoinDesk's longest-running and most influential event that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3.

The name “Mareva” comes from the original 1975 English case: Mareva Compania Naviera SA v. International Bulkcarriers SA. In Canada (which has a separate and independent legal system from the United Kingdom), if a purported fraud victim, or plaintiff, sues an alleged fraudster, or defendant, the plaintiff can request the court proactively freeze the defendant’s assets before the trial. This prevents the defendant from disposing of the assets to avoid paying the plaintiff in the event of an unfavorable civil judgment.',\n  \"Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022\",\n  'Lich became a Mareva defendant, and the face of the so-called Canada “Freedom Convoy,” due to her role in organizing and raising funds for the month-long protests that sought to pressure politicians to remove Canada’s COVID-19 mandates.',\n  'She didn’t act alone, but as one of the more popular figures (if not the most popular) among the protests’ organizers, she became the face of the protest movement. Embittered downtown Ottawa residents (where the protests took place from Jan. 22 to Feb. 23, 2022) named her (and 79 other defendants) in a class-action lawsuit seeking over C$306 million (currently US$228 million) in “compensation for damages inflicted upon those who live, carry on business, or work in the [Ottawa] downtown core.”',\n  'Court documents show Lich was “the organizer of the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser on the crowdsourced fundraising platforms GoFundMe and GiveSendGo.” According to The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, the convoy raised over $24 million, most of which was returned to donors after GoFundMe raised concerns about the nature of the protests. GiveSendGo followed suit after being forced to halt the campaign via a court order initiated by the Ontario provincial government.',\n  \"Read more: Court Orders Freeze of Canadian 'Freedom Convoy' Crypto Fundraising\",\n  'During the final days of the demonstrations, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in the country’s history. This gave the federal government additional powers to help quell the protests, such as the ability to freeze bank accounts linked to the Freedom Convoy and its supporters.',\n  'With traditional funding mechanisms shuttered, Lich and team turned to crypto. On-chain data shows the Convoy raised about 20 bitcoin (BTC), worth roughly $1.1 million at the time.',\n  'Then the class action plaintiffs came across “considerable evidence about the plans to distribute the funds as soon as possible, in part to benefit the individual protestors, but also, to avoid any enforcement activity,” court documents state. That’s when the Mareva injunction was requested and granted.',\n  'The injunction seems to have been partially successful, and a combination of crypto and cash totaling over $6 million was eventually transferred to a third-party escrow account and frozen until the conclusion of the class action, which is still ongoing as of this publication.',\n  \"Read more: 'Frozen' Bitcoin Tied to Canadian Protests Lands at Coinbase, Crypto.Com\",\n  'The key word there is \"partially.\" According to an article by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), police only managed to seize about 6 BTC out of the 20 BTC raised.

These securities brokers are required to send you and the IRS a copy of your 1099-B at the end of each year reporting your cost basis, proceeds and associated gains or losses from each of your transactions that occurred on the broker’s platform. (“Cost basis” refers to the original value of an asset or investment for tax purposes.)',\n  'You as the taxpayer use this 1099-B to report your capital gains or losses on your taxes, and the IRS uses it to verify that you reported the correct amount of income.',\n  'At first glance, it makes sense for regulators to want the same 1099 requirements for Coinbase and Kraken as forCharles Schwab and Robinhood. Both platforms broker the sale or exchange of capital assets that result in capital gain income.',\n  'But from a technical perspective cryptocurrency and digital assets operate completely differently from equities. It’s this fundamental difference that makes 1099-B a poor solution for crypto transaction reporting, and it’s this difference that is going to lead to immense pain for taxpayers as 1099-B reporting gets rolled out across all major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges in the years to come.',\n  'Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022',\n  'Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies and digital assets are built to be interoperable.

The cost associated with running third-party entities to be middlemen for “transferring value” can now be removed, and those economic resources can be deployed more efficiently across the economy.',\n  'Peer-to-peer interoperability is a massive technical breakthrough.',\n  'Unfortunately, it’s this interoperability that makes 1099-B a terrible solution for tax information reporting for cryptocurrency exchanges.',\n  'Because you can send cryptocurrencies and digital assets freely into or out of your cryptocurrency exchange from any wallet, exchanges won’t always have the cost basis information for your digital assets held on their platform.',\n  'Remember, digital assets like bitcoin know no physical boundaries. You can freely send your bitcoin or ether from a wallet that you self-custody into your exchange of choice, without friction.',\n  'These wallet-wallet digital asset transfers happen millions of times every single day.',\n  'As a result, when you transfer your cryptocurrency assets into your exchange of choice, your exchange typically does not know the original cost basis for that cryptocurrency .',\n  'This is critical to understand. If your cryptocurrency exchange accepts wallet transfers into its platform, your exchange will not always be able to fully complete a 1099-B for you because it’s missing a critical component for reporting: cost basis.',\n  'Say you buy 1 bitcoin for $20,000 from Cryptocurrency Exchange A. Immediately after the purchase, you send it to your self-custodied wallet for safekeeping. Months later, after bitcoin has skyrocketed in price, you decide it’s time to sell so you send your bitcoin from your self-custodied wallet to your other exchange, Cryptocurrency Exchange B, and sell it for $50,000.',\n  'In this simplistic example, Cryptocurrency Exchange B has no idea that your cost basis for your 1 bitcoin is $20,000. Cryptocurrency Exchange B only sees a transfer of 1 bitcoin into its platform from a third-party wallet and a sale of this BTC for $50,000.',\n  'With the passage of the infrastructure bill, Cryptocurrency Exchange B will be required to report this disposal of BTC on a 1099-B to the IRS. However, it will be reported with a blank, or null, cost basis field:',\n  'When the IRS receives a copy of this 1099-B, it will see that you sold $50,000 of bitcoin on Cryptocurrency Exchange B. However, it will not be able to see that your true capital gains for this transaction were actually only $30,000. It will be up to you to prove your cost basis was indeed $20,000. If you can’t prove it, you could be stuck with a zero-dollar cost basis and face a $50,000 capital gain tax bill.',\n  'This, of course, is going to happen at scale, for millions of taxpayers, with millions of 1099-Bs, all with blank or unknown cost basis fields.',\n  'Read more: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022',\n  'I know what you’re thinking.',\n  '“We should just require exchanges to report cost basis information to each other whenever customers transfer digital assets to and from their platform!

They don’t depend on centralized third-party companies to exist or operate. Yes, many centralized companies (crypto exchanges) have popped up to make it easier for users to interact with blockchains themselves, but these centralized exchanges are not the only players in this market.',\n  'The ecosystem consists of thousands of decentralized wallets, protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and other applications that enable users to interact with these same blockchains – whether using a centralized third party or not.',\n  'For 1099-B reporting to be truly effective (in the way that it is effective for traditional equities brokers), cryptocurrency brokers would have to operate in a siloed, walled-garden fashion. They wouldn’t be able to allow transfers into or out of their platforms if the counterparty couldn’t pass along or store sensitive customer data for them. If they did, they wouldn’t be able to accurately report cost basis and thus gains/losses to users.',\n  'Is Coinbase going to shut down the ability of its users to accept wallet deposits from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, self-custodied wallets, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other decentralized market participants that don’t have the ability to report a user’s cost basis, name, address and Social Security number upon a transfer into a Coinbase custodied wallet?',\n  'Given its mission of enabling an open financial system, I hope not.',\n  'The 1099-B is not the solution for cryptocurrency tax reporting.',\n  'Financially incentivized market participants that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital will try to convince you that it is but alas, it is not.',\n  'Digital assets will continue to operate in an open and decentralized fashion whether or not regulators force the hand of America’s largest cryptocurrency brokers. The genie is out of the bottle, and decentralized applications used by millions of people all over the world are only going to become more developed in the years ahead.',\n  'So, instead of enforcing 1099 reporting that was developed for a completely different asset class, what if we came up with new, more sensible rules?

Things can get confusing quickly.',\n  'Miles Fuller is head of government solutions for TaxBit, a provider of tax and accounting services focused on digital assets.',\n  'The IRS classifies cryptocurrency as virtual currency, which is property for tax purposes. This classification means the agency treats crypto as a capital asset in almost all cases. Taxes on capital assets are straightforward.',\n  'This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week',\n  'When you sell a capital asset for fiat currency or exchange it for other property or for services, you take the amount received for that transaction and reduce it by the amount you paid for the asset. Your original purchase price is known as cost basis.',\n  'If the proceeds of a crypto transaction exceed the cost, you have a capital gain. Likewise, if the inverse is true, you have a capital loss.',\n  'If you hold the asset for under 12 months, it will be treated as a short-term capital gain; if you hold the asset for over 12 months, it will be treated as a long-term capital gain.',\n  'A common question that arises during a crypto transaction – whether involving a single asset or multiple assets – is “How do I calculate the cost basis?” When you sell property, existing tax regulations require you to apply the cost basis of that specific property against the proceeds received to calculate your gain or loss. However, this isn’t possible for fungible property like crypto because it lacks a specific identifier for each unit specifically tracking when the unit was purchased and when that same unit was sold.',\n  'In October 2019, the IRS posted FAQs on its website that explain how to approach cost basis calculations for cryptocurrency. FAQs 39, 40 and 41 address cryptocurrency cost basis.',\n  'The IRS takes a similar approach to cryptocurrency cost basis as traditional equities and allows two methods for calculating cost basis when disposing of virtual currency:',\n  'First-in, First-out (FIFO) is a method of assigning the cost basis where the oldest unit of crypto you own is sold or disposed of first.',\n  'What are the potential benefits of FIFO?',\n  'FIFO currently allows universal pooling of assets, which makes this an easier method to apply than Specific Identification.',\n  'Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022',\n  'The IRS FAQs don’t specifically address what method is required for FIFO, so a taxpayer can use either approach – pool all their accounts together or prepare separate FIFO calculations for each wallet or account.',\n  'You can weigh your options, but if the exchange issued a Form 1099 to you, then it probably used a by-exchange approach. The same approach is likely easiest when completing your personal tax forms and could also reduce the chance of an audit because your return will match the information that the exchange provided to the IRS.',\n  'In November 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Infrastructure Bill, which requires crypto information reporting on transactions to be conducted by brokers.',\n  'This new legislation will likely result in IRS regulations that mirror current rules for stocks. Each crypto exchange will be reporting proceeds and basis for sales on its own platform. The FIFO approach is likely to shift toward a by-exchange basis because that’s the information that will be provided.',\n  'While FIFO may be easier to apply, it doesn’t always provide the best tax result. The oldest units you own may have lower cost basis, which could result in larger capital gains.',\n  'Specific Identification permits a taxpayer to identify which units of crypto are being sold in a particular transaction. Under Specific Identification, a taxpayer can elect to dispose of higher cost basis assets first, which allows for greater tax optimization, but the IRS imposes additional requirements to use this method.',\n  'Note that IRS FAQ 40 explicitly requires a taxpayer using Specific Identification to have \"records showing the transaction information for all units of a specific virtual currency … held in a single account, wallet, or address.”',\n  'You can’t use Specific Identification with cost basis and sale proceeds for crypto from different wallets or exchanges. You can only use Specific Identification with transactions from the same wallet or exchange.',\n  'Additionally, to use Specific Identification, you must have complete records including the:',\n  'While FIFO may be the default by some providers, Specific Identification offers many possible tax advantages to the taxpayer. Most importantly, it provides flexibility that can help minimize taxes in both the current year and long term.',\n  'Assume the purchase price of your longest-held units of a particular cryptocurrency is much lower than units you just acquired. If you applied FIFO to a sale of these units, you would likely report a gain for tax purposes.',\n  'Conversely, if you use Specific Identification on a by-exchange basis, you could select and sell the units with the highest cost basis regardless of acquisition date, which could reduce the gain or even result in a loss.',\n  'Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022',\n  \"For example, let's say a taxpayer sells BTC for $10,000. You can see the difference when FIFO and Specification Identification methods are applied to the transaction:\",\n  'Because Specific Identification is an election, failure to do the proper calculation or maintain complete records could result in an IRS audit where you’ll potentially need to redo the calculation using FIFO.',\n  'If you’re considering using Specific Identification to achieve tax optimization, you should ensure that whoever is doing the tax calculation – you, your preparer or any software provider – is applying Specific Identification on a per account or wallet basis.',\n  'Unlike the regulations governing stocks, the IRS Cryptocurrency FAQs don’t provide specific instructions on when to elect Specific Identification or how to do it. Unlike equities, some exchanges don’t even allow a Specific Identification election within their platform.',\n  'If the exchange doesn’t allow the election, you’ll need to complete it manually or use crypto tax software.

Other notable gainers on the list of coins with at least $1 billion market value are blockchain-like public network Hedera's HBAR token, up 14.5%, and Avalanche's AVAX cryptocurrency, up 12%.\",\n  \"LUNA's leadership perhaps stems from Singapore-based non-profit organization Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) decision to create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized stablecoin, whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.\",\n  'LFG announced on Tuesday that it had raised $1 billion through private token sales to build the bitcoin reserve and the buyers will lock up the coins for a four-year vesting period. The funding round was led by the likes of Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital.',\n  '\"Raising a BTC reserve is a smart move and may result in lesser fluctuations of UST during future bouts of market volatility,\" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. \"Ideally, LFG would take steps to keep the reserve 100% on-chain for transparency rather than through centralized means, however, the price action of Luna since the announcement has been largely promising in restoring confidence to the Terra ecosystem.\"',\n  \"Pseudonymous decentralized finance researcher Westie tweeted that the deal is extremely important for Terra's stability, LUNA's value capture.\",\n  \"Increased stability might bring more robust demand for UST, resulting in reduced LUNA supply. LUNA's fortunes are closely tied to UST as the stablecoin's creation is facilitated by burning LUNA. In other words, to mint 1 UST, $1 worth of LUNA must be taken out of circulation.\",\n  \"According to the data tracking website CoinGecko, UST's market capitalization has surged from roughly $300 million to over $12 billion in one year, establishing the dollar-pegged digital asset as the fourth-biggest stablecoin worldwide. Meanwhile, LUNA has chalked up a near sixfold rally in the past 12 months.\",\n  \"Unlike tether and other centralized stablecoins, UST isn't backed by dollars and its peg is maintained by allowing users to alter UST and LUNA supplies.\",\n  \"Here is how it works: Terra's swap function allows users to always swap $1 worth of Luna for 1 UST, and vice versa, according to the official blog. So when UST trades at $0.98, users can buy one UST for $0.98 and then swap the same for $1 of LUNA through Terra's swap function and sell LUNA in the market. The protocol burns one UST and mints LUNA, driving UST's supply lower and putting upward pressure on UST's price.\",\n  \"On the other hand, if UST trades at $1.02, LUNA holders can swap $1 worth of LUNA for 1 UST through the swap function and sell the UST in the market at $1.02, pocketing the difference. In the process, the protocol burns LUNA and mints UST, increasing the stablecoin's supply and putting downward pressure on the peg.\",\n  'The mechanism is rewarding during bull runs but can be detrimental during a market crash when there is less incentive to mint either of the two coins to keep the peg intact, as explained in a Twitter thread by Westie.',\n  \"The bitcoin reserve is expected to mitigate that risk to some extent, given the top cryptocurrency is less correlated to Terra's ecosystem and arbitrageurs can swap UST to bitcoin to support UST's peg. In a press release, the Luna Foundation Guard said that moving forward, it may introduce other major non-correlated assets within the market to the reserve.\",\n  '\"The fund will serve as a \"release valve\" for UST redemptions during selloffs [periods of significant UST demand contraction],\" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.',\n  '\"The UST Forex Reserve further strengthens confidence in the peg of the market\\'s leading decentralized stablecoin UST,\" Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, said in a press release. \"It can be used to help protect the peg of the UST stablecoin in stressful conditions. This is similar to how many central banks hold reserves of foreign currencies to back monetary liabilities and protect against dynamic market conditions.\"',\n  \"Looking ahead, the investor optimism from LFG's reserve announcement, coupled with signs of risk reset in the broader market and the impending launch of Mars Protocol's lockdrop, could keep LUNA better bid.\",\n  '\"Lockdrop allows users to lock UST into Mars\\' Red Bank in exchange for a distribution of $MARS tokens that are claimable once the protocol launches,\" analytics firm Delphi Digital said in a daily market update. The protocol goes live today, and users will have until Friday to participate in the lockdrop.',\n  '\"Mars (an advanced money market protocol) is (finally) launching, with $18.5 million of UST locked up for Phase 1 of the token distribution,\" Tagus\\'s Solot said.',\n  'Disclosure',\n  'Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
